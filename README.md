# Carnival Demo - Library

This project demonstrates a basic library that uses Carnival.  Carnival libraries can be useful to encapsulate sharable graph models, vines, and graph methods.  For example, [carnival-openspecimen](https://github.com/carnival-data/carnival-openspecimen) is a library that contains a vine implementation to read data from the OpenSpecimen API.
